# The Code Graveyard

The Code Graveyard is a website for sharing dead code bases, applications, and companies. Originally it was code-base focused in my mind, hence the name, then it turned more 'story' focused.

This is a work-in-progress concept.

## Requirements

- Ruby 2.6.6

## Setup

- `bundle install`
- `bundle exec jekyll serve`
